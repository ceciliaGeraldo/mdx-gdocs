# API Integration Guide

This guide covers how to integrate with our REST API for developers.

## Authentication

Before making requests, you need to authenticate using an API key.

Steps to get started:
1. Register for an account
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard  
3. Include the key in your requests

## Making Requests

All API requests should be made to https://api.example.com

### GET Request Example

To fetch user data:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.example.com/users/123
```

Important: Always use HTTPS for security.

## Rate Limiting

The API has rate limits:
- 100 requests per minute for free accounts
- 1000 requests per minute for premium accounts

If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a 429 status code.

## Error Handling

Common HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 401: Unauthorized (check your API key)
- 404: Resource not found
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 500: Server error

Make sure to handle these errors gracefully in your application.
