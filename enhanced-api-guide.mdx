# API Integration Guide

This guide provides developers with instructions on integrating with our REST API.

## 1. Authentication

Before making any API requests, you must authenticate using an API key. Follow these steps:

1. **Register for an Account:** Create an account on our platform.
2. **Generate an API Key:** Access your dashboard and generate a new API key.
3. **Include the Key in Your Requests:** Add your API key to the request headers as described in the next section.

## 2. Making API Requests

All API requests should be made to `https://api.example.com`. Always use HTTPS for secure communication.

### 2.1 GET Request Example

This example demonstrates fetching user data using a GET request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.example.com/users/123
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

:::tip
Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated API key.
:::

## 3. Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the API implements rate limiting:

<Tabs groupId="rate-limits">
  <TabItem value="free" label="Free Accounts">
    100 requests per minute
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="premium" label="Premium Accounts">
    1000 requests per minute
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429` HTTP status code.

:::warning
Exceeding the rate limit will result in a 429 error.
:::

## 4. Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of requests. Proper error handling is crucial for a robust integration. Here are some common codes:

<Details>
  <Summary>Common HTTP Status Codes</Summary>
  <ul>
    <li>**200 OK:** The request was successful.</li>
    <li>**401 Unauthorized:** Invalid or missing API key. Check your authentication details.</li>
    <li>**404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.</li>
    <li>**429 Too Many Requests:** Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before retrying.</li>
    <li>**500 Internal Server Error:** An unexpected error occurred on the server.</li>
  </ul>
</Details>
