# Getting Started with Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that helps you manage containerized applications at scale.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

### Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Automatically scale your applications up or down
- **High Availability**: Ensure your applications are always running
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently use your infrastructure

## Basic Concepts

### Pods
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

### Services
Services provide a stable network endpoint for your Pods, even as they come and go.

### Deployments
Deployments manage the desired state of your application, handling updates and rollbacks.

## Example Configuration

Here's a simple deployment configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Next Steps

1. Install kubectl command-line tool
2. Set up a local cluster with minikube
3. Deploy your first application
4. Learn about advanced features like Ingress and ConfigMaps
